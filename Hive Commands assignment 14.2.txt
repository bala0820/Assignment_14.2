1. Fetch date and temperature from temperature_data where zip code is greater than 300000 and less than 399999.

select * from temperature_data where zip > 300000 and zip < 399999;

2. Calculate maximum temperature corresponding to every year from temperature_data table.

select MAX(temp), SUBSTRING(date,6,10) as year from temperature_data where temp != 9999 group by date;

3. Calculate maximum temperature from temperature_data table corresponding to those years which have at least 2 entries in the table.

SELECT date, AVG(max_temperature)
FROM (
  SELECT date, MAX(temp) AS max_temperature
  FROM temperature_data
  WHERE temp != 9999

4. CREATE VIEW temp_v(dateString, tempint) AS SELECT date, AVG(max_temperature)

5. Export contents from temperature_data_vw to a file in local file system, such that each file is '|' delimited.
